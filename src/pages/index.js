                Astral Pictures was started in the summer of 2001 when Chris Cunningham and Danny Pelletier decided to make a movie that made fun of all of the terrible horror movies they were watching. Admittingly, our first movie turned out to be awful as well, but it laid the foundation for future endeavors and sparked an interest that continues to this day.

It was also a fun learning experience to be running around the streets at one in the morning with a giant plastic pumpkin duct taped to my head, going into a bar with a bright red cape and a birthday hat and interviewing people, and having a retarded zombie ride a bicycle to get around - all while being filmed. There's nothing as exciting as seeing an idea in my mind being finally played out on the screen.

Filming a scene
We have 6 short films under our belts, a handful of short and feature-length screenplays, and various other media experience including promos, a music video, public access television productions, and editing jobs.
