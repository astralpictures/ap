                Logline: After playing with a Ouija Board, Bryan believes that he and his friends accidentally unleashed a vampire-like spirit that slowly drains their life energy. Driven to near madness, Bryan must find and destroy the monster before it kills them all.

The film is currently in the pre-production stage. Writing began around 2001-2002, and the screenplay has undergone many changes over the years. As of now, the film is being budgeted, and the screenplay is being broken down for production. Previous plans were to film the movie using either super8 or 16mm film. However, due to lower costs and the significant increase in video quality, the movie will most likely be shot using an HDSLR camera.

Logline: After having a crazy vision, a suicidal man believes that the world is about to end. He sets out on a road trip to try and find the father who abandoned him before the coming apocalypse, but instead finds himself along the way.

The screenplay is currently being developed and written. The idea began years ago, and was based on a dream. Over the years, the premise, characters, and their motivations have changed drastically. The story is a mixture between dark comedy and drama. Writing began a few years ago, but stalled because of a lack of direction. However, the story is well under way now, and the script should be finished in the near future. Graduate school has stalled my writing for a while, but I hope to get back to it shortly.
